== Description ==

Hayyat Apps's affordability calculator allows you to customize your payment details, while also providing helpful suggestions in each field to get you started. You can calculate affordability based on your annual income, monthly debts and down payment, or based on your estimated monthly payments and down payment amount.

Our calculator also includes advanced filters to help you get a more accurate estimate of your house affordability, including specific amounts of property taxes, homeowner's insurance and HOA dues (if applicable).

Our home affordability calculator considers the following 4 common factors to estimate the mortgage you might afford:

1. Housing expense to income ratio
2. Total debt to income ratio (DTI)
3. Available funds (for closing costs and down payment)
4. Housing expenses (property tax, insurance, pmi, hoa, other)
